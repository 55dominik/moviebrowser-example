## Foundation - Mobile developer technical assessment
​
### Introduction
​
Using the application framework provided for you, **create a movie browsing application** that displays a list of most popular movies, as well as some basic details about them.
​
### Implementation details
- Use the application framework provided for you.
- Write your application using Kotlin.
- The project is a git repository. Use git as you see fit.
- Use the latest version of [TMDB api](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) to fetch data about movies. An API key is provided for you in the source code.
- Create a screen to show a list of trending movies. Display some additional info including the movie poster, title, its genres and rating.
- Selecting a movie from the list, the user should navigate to the detail page of that movie, that displays some additional info.
- Please note that TMDB uses unique genre IDs that need to be resolved using a separate API call. Do not hardcore genres into your application.

### Notes
- The application framework that is provided for you uses an MVVM approach. We advise to separate your code into layers that you see fit in this architecture.
- Instead of proof of concept style solutions, we would be interested how you would implement the task as a scalable solution
